# Why you should choose C++ for competitive programming

- In competitive programming, where time and memory constraints are crucial, C++ will give you the most efficient output.
- Its Standard Template Library (STL) provides a rich set of data structures and algorithms.
- C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing you to organize your code into reusable and modular components.
- It provides manual memory management, giving you fine control over memory allocation and deallocation.
- You can find a wealth of resources, tutorials, and solutions in C++ for a variety of problems, making it easier to learn and improve your skills.

# What is STL

STL stands for Standard Template Library, which includes a wide range of data structures (such as vectors, queues, stacks, maps, and sets) and algorithms (such as sorting and searching). It can significantly reduce the amount of code you need to write, allowing for faster and more concise implementations.
